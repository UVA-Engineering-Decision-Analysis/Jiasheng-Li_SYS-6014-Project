# Jiasheng-Li_SYS-6014-Project
## Introduction
This study discuss the application of using the result of LSTM to build a statistical decision model by following the reproducible principle.   
## Installation guide
Clone the repository to your workstation. Then you can directly run the predictiveMaintenance.py under the code file folder if you have successfuly have: python 3, together with packages including: 
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. sklearn
5. keras
6. tensorflow (as backend of keras)

## Data
The datasets are available in the data folder, which consists traning dataset, test set and corresponding ground truth data.
## Results and outputs
The files under the output file folder can be generated by the programm directly. 
## Other notes
For decision component, please refer to the final report. Final report is under the Final Report& Assignments folder.
