    "## Introduction\n",
    "Long-short term memory(LSTM) is appealing to time series analysis because of its ability to learn the time dependency in data and the superior performance. However most of the research focused on the performance evaluation but paid less attention to the application of result. Therefore, this study discuss the application of using the result of LSTM to build a statistical decision model by following the reproducible principle.   \n",
    "Note: the pdf written by jupyter notebook cannot show images. Please check out the jupyter notebook for more information. The figure, LSTM model and results can directly be generated by the program under code directory."

    "## Background\n",
    "The motivation of this study was to build a binary classification model according to Predictive Maintenance Template (Predictive Maintenance Template, 2015). It enables engineers to maintain the assets, including which the aircraft engine, machine, turbines, etc., in advance by the prediction result of a model.  \n",
    "The importance of the decision in the context of this study can be explained by the Framing biases in human decision making process. When facing the potential failure risk, there are two kinds of losses, which are defined as payoffs in this study. However, human operators who in charges of the operation of an asset may take risks to continue operated the machine to avoid huge asset suspension fare, with the risk of spending larger further maintenance fare after asset failure by making false decision. A decision analysis model may help human operators realize the utilities of his decisions and therefore minimize the potential loss.   \n",
    "The dataset is available on the internet, which records the information of aircraft engine use life. The function of prediction component: a binary classification tell us whether or not the engine will fail in 30 cycles. By the great performance of deep learning models, this study choose Long-short term memory(LSTM) to predict time series. After the training and test of LSTM complete. The decision analysis component will be finished by using a decision tree analysis. The trade off between using the 'empirical' conjecture or using the LSTM model to predict will be discussed in the following content. \n",

    "## Prediction component \n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The prediction component is achieved by LSTM model. The procedure follows the common procedue in deep learning and the predictive maintenance template. The description of data set is shwon in Figure 1."

    "As introduced previously, when the operator or manager is given the information of potential risk, some may choose to suspend the engine, some may let it continue operating. Such information can be given by previous experience, or by the prediction model achieved above. Therefore there are two different decision tree to be considered. For further analysis, other terms will be described below.\n",

    "1. In reality, the RUL is not known. But we assume it can be predicted as well (through regression), and the difference between the real RUL and predicted RUL can be neglected for classification study like this.\n",

    "1. The classification problem can be extended to muticlassification problem, which means that we can make more decisions in a large window w0. Therefore there will be more information available for decision makers.   \n",
    "2. The decision simplified the real situation and only consider a single moment decision making process.   \n",
    "3. A more comprehensive statistical model is required for more analysis.   \n",
